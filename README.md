# Brief Overview

Baby Tracker is meant to be a very light-weight tracker app for new (or new
again) parents to track diaper changes and feedings for their newborn child.
It's limited to only one child currently* (my apologies to parents of twins...).

*A work-around would be to use this app on two different devices, using one
device for one child and the other device for the other child.

## Important Notes

* If you look at the code, you'll notice no data is collected and submitted
  anywhere. Your data is your own, and it doesn't leave your device.
* Baby Tracker utilizes local storage, so if you clear your browser's cache or
  browsing data, you will most likely lose your tracking history. PLEASE be
  careful before pulling that trigger if you want to keep your tracking history.

## Features

* Simplistic, minimal UI: fewer distractions
* No ads (because I hate ads ðŸ˜›)
* Visual distinction between different actions (diaper changes, bottle feeding,
  breastfeeding)

# Requested (Upcoming) Features
* "Feeding Window Approaching" notification
* User Settings modal
* Import/Export data

# Future of Baby Tracker

* I may want to add things such as cool graphs and charts to help visualize the
  data collected by parents.
* Or the option to add notifications if your baby's feeding window is
  approaching.
* Or the ability to define a custom feeding window.
* Maybe there'll be more things to track in the future.
* Or I should probably make it look better first... ðŸ˜…
